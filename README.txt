First keep all the files in the same directory including the given input file **"A1input.txt"**.  
I have used a total of 5 functions. The function declarations are in the **f.h** file and the function definitions are in the **f.cpp** file.  
Run the **main.cpp** file (which contains `main()`) otherwise it would show an error.  
The functions require input by the user.  
If proper input is given, all the functions run successfully.
